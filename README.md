libraries needed to run the crawler
	requests
	googlesearch 
	beautiful soup
This can be run as a standalone or import the thing eg:

```
	from crawler import * 
	crawler=Crawler()
	crawler(<'the url you want to search ''>)
	
```
The output still needs some filtering
That is a todo




Check the output and tell me mr roy
This gives the url but still i cannot figure out how to distinguish between what is the headline and which part is the news
